## INTRODUCTION





## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The proliferation of online streaming platforms has created an ocean of cinematic choices, leaving users adrift in the quest for their next movie night selection. Navigating this vast sea of options can be daunting and time-consuming, often resulting in decision fatigue and missed opportunities to explore content aligned with one's preferences. My project seeks to address this issue by crafting a sophisticated movie recommendation system capable of leveraging user data and machine learning to deliver personalized movie suggestions. It aims to tackle the challenge of guiding users toward enjoyable movie choices, even for those who are new to the platform or movies with limited ratings.


## MAIN OBJECTIVE
To create a movie recommendation system that suggests the top 5 movies to users based on their ratings of other movies.

## SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES
- To evaluate a comprehensive evaluation of user-based and item-based recommendation algorithm.
- To assess the impact of implicit feedback
- To address the cold start problem

## DATA UNDERSTANDING
1.Data Source
-The dataset used in this project for building a recommendation system was sourced from the GroupLens research lab at the University of Minnesota.

-The data provided is in CSV format.

2.Data Features
-Movie Data: Information about movies is available, including movie IDs, titles, genres, release years, and potentially other metadata.

-Ratings Data: The core of the dataset consists of user ratings for movies, with each record typically containing user IDs, movie IDs, and the corresponding ratings.

3.Data Quality
-Missing Values: An initial check reveals that there are no missing values in the user IDs, movie IDs, or ratings fields.

-Data Consistency: Data consistency checks have been performed, and there are no apparent data inconsistencies or format issues.

-Outliers: An initial examination of ratings data suggests that there are no extreme outliers or unrealistic values.

4.Data Exploration
-Distribution of Ratings: The distribution of user ratings has been visualized, showing the distribution of ratings across the entire dataset. This information can help in understanding user preferences.\

-Movie Genre Distribution: A breakdown of movie genres and their frequency in the dataset has been examined. This helps in understanding the diversity of movie genres available.

5.Data Challenges
-Sparsity: The dataset may suffer from sparsity, where most users have rated only a small subset of movies. This can impact recommendation accuracy.
-Cold Start Problem: Handling new users or movies with very few ratings is a potential challenge. Strategies to address this issue need to be developed.

6.Data Preprocessing
-Data preprocessing steps such as dropping unnecessary columns,merging datasets will be applied as needed.

7.Data Splitting
-The data will be divided into training and testing sets for model evaluation.Standard cross-validation techniques may also be employed.
## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

-The available dataset will be examined through visualizations. so as to gain insights.


## MODELING
-The Baseline model will be a K-nearest neighbors(KNN)
collaborative filtering model to establish a perfomance baseline.I will use cross-validation to assess its predictive accuracy.
-An advanced model i.e. KNNBaseline will be used to account for user and item biases.

## EVALUATION
Performance of recommendation models will use metrics such as RMSE,MAE.
Fine Tuning Hyperparameters using GridSearch will be incorporated so as to improve recommendation accuracy.
